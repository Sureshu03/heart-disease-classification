# heart-disease-classification
The Heart Disease Classification App is an interactive web application built so that enables users to evaluate the likelihood of heart disease using multiple machine learning models.

**Problem Statement**
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of patients at risk can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
This project builds a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to classify heart disease using multiple machine learning models. The app provides predictions and evaluation metrics to compare model performance.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains patient health attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope of ST segment, number of major vessels, and thalassemia type.

**Output**
If the Target value is 1, it indicates the presence of Heart disease. 
If the Target value is 0, it indicates the absence of Heart disease.

**Models Used**
